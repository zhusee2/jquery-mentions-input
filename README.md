jquery.mentionsInput
=================
jquery.mentionsInput is a small, but awesome UI component that allows you to "@mention" someone in a text message, just like you are used to on Facebook or Twitter.

This project is written by [Kenneth Auchenberg](http://kenneth.io), and started as an internal project at [Podio](http://podio.com), but has then been open sourced to give it a life in the community.

## About this fork
This repository is a fork by [Zhusee](https://github.com/zhusee2), since the original project is listed as *no longer maintained*.

## Introduction
To get started -- checkout http://podio.github.com/jquery-mentions-input

## Roadmap
- Fix open issues.
- Seperate mentionsInput from jQuery, and expose as AMD/CJS module.
- Package component up for bower and components.
- Seperate autocompleter, so it's possible to use bootstrap, jquery, etc-autocompleters
- Define better interface to call methods.
- Add the option to have a hidden-input that contains the syntaxed-version, so it's easier to use out of the box.
- Add unit tests!
